Rolling over to a more comfortable position with a smaller probability of accidentally breaking my neck, I started to type my reply. It was a very hot Sunday and the condenser of the air conditioner installed in my room was busted. My consciousness was practically evaporating itself out of my body until just a moment ago.\nThen again soda does sound really nice just about right now though, I made a mental correction to my previous thought.\n\"This is the first time I am aware of the existence of said beverage,\" I replied as my thought was starting to piece itself back together.\n“Sorry I can’t relate but any type of soda right about now does sound nice, it’s so hot”\nThe chat was a particularly welcome guest that day, a relief for the boredom that has been saturating my mind as of recently. The lockdown was starting to take its toll on my (and I imagine everyone else’s) sanity. It has been weeks since I last went out. The fact that the only window in this 4x3 room has a view of a wall from the building next door does not help either.\nWhy don’t viruses take public holidays like people do, I sighed mentally. If this was a normal day a remark that moronic would warrant a few minutes of self loathing but normal days seems so far away right now.\n\"You’re missing out in life then; melon soda is peak soda. Second only to ginger ale,” the heated reply arrived quicker than I expected.\n“Also turn on your AC if it’s so hot.”\nThe circuit breaker would shut down the entire building’s electricity if I do that. Not dealing with that for a second time, I thought.\n“AC’s busted. Send a cold melon soda so I can relate please”\n“Almost impossible to find them here, sadly; if not I won’t even miss them since my fridge would literally be chock full of melon sodas right now. And ice.”\n“Lol,” I laughed without actually laughing.\n\"Can't go on a week without them back when I was in Japan.\"\nThat reminded me, he went to Japan for his master's degree. Spent a good two years there before going back out of obligation. Loved it more than he's willing to publicly admit to anyone but that just makes it kind of funny.\nI paused and imagined the taste of a melon-flavored soda in my head. Failing to directly combine the concept of melon and soda, I tried to imagine a carbonated melon juice. That couldn’t be right, I whisked the imagination away.\n\"Then you've been clean for a year now,\" I started.\n\"From melon soda I mean\"\n\"It’s okay, you can fight your addiction\"\n\"Be strong\"\nHis reply came fast.\n\"Lol.\"\nBefore I got to respond, three small circles started dancing on the bottom of the chat window. Knowing full-well an essay on the wonders of melon soda were being written, I scooted back and rested my back to the cool wall. Small pleasure on this hot day.\n2 minutes later it came. Surprisingly, not the essay I was expecting.\n“It sure doesn’t feel like a year. I can still remember the taste exactly even now.”\n“The human memory is indeed a wonderful thing,” I quickly replied. “You started work like 11 months ago you know”\n“... really?”\n“Well around that time if I remembered correctly…”\n“Wait, why should I remember this anyway”\n“I shouldn’t waste my brain capacity,” I retorted.\n“No you’re right, it was around last January; I came home right in the middle of winter. Winter there, I mean.”\n“I thought you’re talking about the nonexistent winter of this tropical country,” he would appreciate this remark. “Anyway does melon soda taste like melon juice?”\nDancing circles. Actually they look more like they’re doing synchronized swimming.\n“It depends. Are you talking about melon soda or melon ice cream soda?”\nBefore I got to process the existence of an ice cream variety of the fabled beverage, another message popped out.\n“Either doesn’t taste like melon juice though. Does strawberry soda taste like strawberry juice?”\nThat’s a good question.\n“Orange soda tastes kind of like orange juice,” I mentally shrugged.\n“... really?”\n“... no it tastes like chemical flavoring and artificial sweetener lol,” I admitted. “But still I can’t kind wrap my head around what melon soda would taste like”\nA slight fear that this heat is slowly eroding my IQ creeped at the back of my head. I shook it off immediately.\n“Imagine strawberry juice and slowly turn it into strawberry soda. Now apply the same transformation to melon juice.”\nThis activity made me more thirsty than informed.\n“I’ll just take your word that it’s the ultimate soda flavor,” I informed him of my concession.\n“Welcome to the church of melon soda,” I can sense his grin behind the phone screen.\nHuh, worshipping something which I’ve never even tasted nor encountered does feel like church, I thought.\n“So what kind of practice does this religion subscribe to?” still with the religion metaphor, I asked.\n“A can of melon soda after a weekly afternoon jog by the riverbank.”\n“That sounded very counterproductive”\n“What do you mean? Both are good for your soul.”\nI spared no further comment.\n“So this religion does not exist when a city has no nice riverbank to jog by? I don’t think it will gain traction here,” instead, a nonsensical question.\nI can guess the kind of riverbank he’s talking about, ones that you see a lot in tv dramas and animations. Two well-maintained paths for jogging and cycling that run along both sides of the river. Both should be slightly elevated, with grassy slopes that people can comfortably lie down on clear afternoons. Ones that people crowd to watch fireworks. Probably one or two baseball fields for the local schools on the wider side of the bank.\nAnyway it’s exactly the kind of riverbank that doesn’t exist in this city.\n“This city doesn’t even have the soda but yeah I guess, no nice riverbank.”\nIf you don’t know him well, his chats would always feel a little bit curt or sad. Know him long enough and you’ll notice that it’s actually because he doesn’t use emojis or stickers.\n“You still run weekly now?”\n“I don’t. Like everyone else, I now sweat weekly in an exclusive health training facility that requires you to pay a significant portion of your monthly income to keep coming.”\n“Gyms”\n“Yes, that’s what people sometimes call them.”\n“Why don’t you just run in the national stadium?”\n“Too far.”\n“Around your neighborhood?”\n“The streets have no sidewalks and there’s more cars/motorcycles than people at all times. They go quite fast despite how narrow the street is.”\n“That’s pretty sad”\n“That’s just how it is, one can do nothing about it.”\nThe helplessness of those words sank slowly on the back of my mind. It’s pretty terrible how the same could be said for a lot of things that happened recently.\nLocked in for weeks due to the virus, can’t do anything about it.\nI was among the fortunate one, I guess. Many others were forced to go out despite the virus or starve. They can’t do anything about that either.\nEarlier on the news they say that the country’s restarting activities to revive the economy despite the still increasing death tolls. Should they call people back to work from office, then I guess that’s just how it is as well.\nAlso, AC’s broken. Well, I did something about that (called my landlord to ask him for repairs) but ultimately, I can’t do anything more.\nIn the end we’re all living under the mercy of those who actually can do something.\n“Pretty shitty situation huh?”\nIt took me a while to realize that my thoughts spilled over to the conversation.\n“Yeah, I guess my only hope  in this land is that new karaoke joint that just opened right before the lockdown.”\n“Why?”\n“It’s managed by a Japanese company. Karaoke joints there have free-refill drink counters. Of course there’s melon soda.”\n“Did you go to karaoke a lot back in Japan?”\nThe answer to this was actually obvious, we used to go almost every week back in college now that I remembered it. He was not particularly good at it but I guess he likes singing quite a lot.\n“Every week, with friends if there’s anyone free and alone if there isn’t. Wednesday’s karaoke day.”\n“Practically a religious practice,” I typed this reply with a smirk.\n“What can I say I’m a religious guy.”\nHe’s actually not.\n“Must be pretty expensive when you go alone though?” I wouldn’t be surprised if he sacrificed food budgets for this.\nDancing circles. The following reply was a long one.\n“That is exactly why the joints there are great. The fee was per-person instead of per-room. I paid the same amount whether I went alone or with friends. It’s pretty nice to have your solo karaoke need validated by the business. I think that business model is more profitable too, I wonder why the joints here charge per-room...”\nThat does sound great, I thought.\n“Nobody wants to go karaoke here alone”\n“I guess I am nobody.”\n“We are all nobodies,” the comeback jumped out of my mind to the screen almost immediately.\nI hesitated a bit before deciding to send the next message.\n\"You have an awful lot of free time for a graduate student back then,\"\nWas that too intruding? I thought.\nThe reply came around 5 minutes later. I have no idea if he spent those 5 minutes fumbling for a comfortable response or just taking a bathroom break.\nThe wonders of text-based asynchronous communications.\n“I think I just held myself to a relatively low standard compared to others.”\n“Okay”\n“That’s not necessarily a bad thing though, it gave me time and space to do things I wouldn’t do otherwise. Like running.”\n“There’s nothing that kept you from doing that even before you left”\n“I also took up photography and traveled a bit. To be exact I think it’s less about free time and more about not having to worry about stuff.”\n“Stuff?” a vague answer was unlike him.\n“Yeah, you know… families, future plans, career, and all that. Also the pandemic and how shit our government is, if we’re talking about recent stuffs.”\n“You did need to think about your school though,” I reminded him.\n“Yeah but that part is a little bit easier to figure out than the rest. When you put in the correct amount of effort and time you’ll get the correct result. It’s sort of like an equivalent exchange kind of thing.”\nA lot of people will gladly argue with you on that, I thought.\n“Life was simpler.”\nBefore I got the chance to figure out what to say, another message popped out.\n“And melon soda was easy to find.”\nAnd we’re back again. It was a most welcome transition though, the conversation was too heavy for my liking. Not that I have anything else to blame for that but my intrusive personality.\nIt’s not like I can’t sympathize. Everybody dreams of going back to simpler times. There’s that particular period of time where it feels like you’re going through the best part of your life and everything else from that point on is just that. Everything else. The rest of your life. For me it’s high school but I guess for him it’s those two years.\nI would say that statistically (not really, I’m not good with statistics), I think when you’re not even 30 the best part of your life is yet to come, at least in terms of wealth. I don’t think he needs to hear this though, especially since all this are only conjectures on my part.\nScratch that, at these trying times I think no one needs to hear that. Who am I to say that we’re going to outlive this disaster? At this point everyone (bar the very rich, I suppose) is just trying to survive another week, me included.\nCan’t die yet before I know what to live for. Repeating my mantra, I started to type my response on my screen.\n“Amen,” I opted for the short nondescript response.\nDancing circles. This time they stopped after a couple of seconds, only to repeat the same routine for God knows how many times. A short sentence popped out after a while.\n“How’s life going for you then?”\nI stared at the question. It was one I didn’t expect to receive.\n“You must be pretty bored right now,” I replied.\n“I ran out of novels to read.”\nIt was almost like a follow-up question to my previous train of thought. At that point I had realized for some time that my life has gone nowhere for the last couple of months. Part of it of course, due to the pandemic but then again, I wasn’t trying to move anywhere at all.\n“Just order some online”\n“They’re on the way actually, I bought some classics this time.”\n“Moby Dick?” a wild guess.\n“Nah, a complete Dragon Ball reprint lol.”\nI laughed out loud this time. It turned out I wasn’t the only one standing still.\nAnd that’s completely alright, for now.\n“You know what?” I started.\n“?”\n“It’s a really hot day, I think I’m starting to miss melon soda too.”</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"September 11, 2019","title":"Melon Soda","tags":[]}}},"pageContext":{}}}
