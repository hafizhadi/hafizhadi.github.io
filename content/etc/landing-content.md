People simply call me Hafizh (*huh-feez*). I'm a blessed husband currently holding a master's degree in Artificial Intelligence. Making other people (also, machines!) understand things gives me great pleasure. Starting this October I will reside on the Greater Jakarta Area, Indonesia, looking for opportunities to jump in the industry.

Most recently, I belonged to [Murata Lab, Tokyo Institute of Technology](http://www.net.c.titech.ac.jp/index.html) studying polarization on online social networks under the supervision of Professor [Tsuyoshi Murata](http://t2r2.star.titech.ac.jp/cgi-bin/researcherinfo.cgi?lv=en&q_researcher_content_number=CTT100381406). The lab specializes in network science, graph mining, and application of machine learning techniques (e.g. deep learning, embedding) on graph-structured data.

I subscribe to the belief that a symbiotic relationship between the academics and industry will massively benefit both parties. To be someone that could foster this kind of relationship, now I'm seeking for a position in the industry where I can start getting better at making machines (also, people!) understand things. We can happily talk about these stuff and more via [linkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hafizhadi/) or mails; you can reach me at hafizh (dot) adip (at) gmail (dot) com!
